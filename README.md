# Guess the Album

Music trivia game that tests users' knowledge of popular albums released during the latter half of the 20th century up until today. The albums are pulled from [Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums List](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/).

Users are shown the album art, album name, and artist, and are instructed to guess what year an album was released. Users are scored based on how far off from the actual release year their guess was.
